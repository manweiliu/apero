  I often choke on being asked "what do you do when you are not doing research or teaching?" Not that I live an unconscious life, but the contingency of "not doing research or teaching" is ambiguously defined. I blame my brain for the ambiguity as it constantly mingles what I wish it is doing (i.e. research) and what it is actually doing, leaving a huge grey area between "definitely research" and "research-free" activities. 
  
  Forget about the false work-life dichotomy. I blog because my research and teaching intertwine with things I enjoy in my non-intellectual life. If the latter sounds unprofessional to you, feel free to ignore [~~Blog~~](/project) and focus on my [research](/project).
